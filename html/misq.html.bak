				(1) Write a program to round off an integer i to the next largest
multiple of another integer j . For example, 256 days when
rounded off to the next largest multiple divisible by a week
results into 259.<br><br>
				(2) Temperature of a city in farenheit degrees is entered through
the keyboard. Write a program to convert and print the
temperature in centigrade degrees.<br><br>
				(3) Write a program to find out how many days and how many
weeks have passed between the dates 01/01/92 to 31/05/92.
Also find out how many days could not get evened out into
weeks.<br><br>
				(4) A number is entered through the keyboard. The number may
contain 1,2,3,4, or 5 digits. Write a program to find the number
of digits in the number.<br><br>
				(5) The equation x<sup>2</sup>+ y<sup>2</sup> = r represents a circle with centre at
origin and radius r. Write a program that reads r from the
keyboard and prints the number of points with integer coordinates
that lie within the circle.<br><br>
				(6) Write a program which finds four digit perfect squares where
the number represented by the first two digits and the number
represented by the last two digits are also perfect squares.<br><br>
				(7) If a number 972 is entered through the keyboard, your program
should print "Nine Seven Two". Write the program such that
it does this for any positive integer.<br><br>
				(8) Two dates are entered through the keyboard in dd,mm,yy
format. Write a program to find out the difference in these two
dates in terms of number of days.<br><br>
				(9) Consider a currency system in which there are notes of seven
denominations, namely,<br>
Re. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100<br>
If a sum of Rs. N is entered through the keyboard, write a program to compute the smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N.	<br><br>
				(10) What is the output of the following<br><code>
#define ISLP(y)((y%400 == 0)||(y%100 != 0 &amp;&amp;y%4 == 0))<br>
int main()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int y = 1992;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (ISLP(y))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Leap year");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf ("Not a Leap year");<br>	
}</code><br><br>
				(11) What is the output of the following<br>
<code>#define MYFILE "conio.h"<br>
#include MYFILE<br>
main()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window ( 1 0 , 1 0 , 4 0 , 2 0 );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cprintf ("A pinch of probably is much better than...");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cprintf ("A pound of perhaps!");<br>
}</code><br><br>
				(12) The first difference D1 of a sequence A of N elements is obtained by subtracting each element, except the last, from the next element in the array. The second difference D2 is defined as the first difference of D1, and so on. For example, if<br>
A: 1,2,4,7,11,16, 22, then<br>
D1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6<br>
D2:1,1,1,1,1<br>
D3: 0, 0, 0, 0<br>
Write a program that reads a sequence of 25 elements in an array and finds its first, second, and third differences.<br><br>
				(13) A common problem in statistics is that of generating frequency distribution of the given data. Assuming that the data consists
of 50 positive integers in the range 1 to 25, write a program that prints the number of times each integer occurs in the data.<br><br>
				(14) Write a function xstrstr() that will return the position where one string is present within another string. If the second string doesn't occur in the first string xstrstr() should return a 0. For example, in the string "somewhere over the rainbow", "over" is present at position 11.<br><br>
				(15) Write a program to compress the following string such that the multiple blanks are eliminated. Store the compressed message in another string. Also write a decompressant program to get back the original string with all its spaces restored.<br>        
"Imperial&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Palace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attention Julius&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caesar.<br>
Dear Caesar,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clarification you requested.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Details&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; follow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by courier.<br> Meanwhile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brutus."<br>
